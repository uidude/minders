      <p>Minders is a personal project to track todos that I use daily. I’m opening it up to a
        handful of trusted friends to see if it can help you as well.</p>

      <p>The app evolved from a spreadsheet-based workflow to track todos that I was using
        because no todo list apps ever worked for me. The web UI focuses on a few key flows:
        adding Minders quickly, showing the Minders that are “In focus” and you might work on now,
        and reviewing the other Minders to decide whether to pull any In focus.</p>

      <p>If you’re wondering why both the app and the todos are called “Minders” (and
        “todo” and “task” are nowhere to be seen)...  for now you’ll have to conjecture.
        Soon I’ll add an About section with more detail on the evolution of the app and the
        terminology.</p>

      <p>Click on login button below to try out the app. You’ll be prompted to authorize the app to
        create a Google spreadsheet to hold your Minders.</p>

      <p>Hope this is helpful in organizing your daily work!</p>
